# Rowell Ranch Rodeo

Welcome to the Rowell Ranch Rodeo Website! This is a full-stack, single-page application designed for the Rowell Ranch Rodeo. Users can sign in, purchase tickets for events using the Stripe API for secure payment processing, and view their order history. In addition, employees with admin privileges can create, update, and delete events, manage them in both a list view and calendar view, and utilize the Leaflet calendar. The application is also responsive to ensure a seamless user experience across devices.
